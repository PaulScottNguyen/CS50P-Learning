In Week 6 of CS50P, I learned how to interact with files using Python. This ability allows programs to read from and write to files, enabling data persistence and more dynamic applications.

What I Learned

- File I/O (Input/Output) - Python can read and write files, making it possible to store and retrieve data across sessions.
- open() Function - Used to open files in various modes:
"r": Read
"w": Write (overwrites existing content)
"a": Append
"rb" / "wb": Read/write in binary mode
- close() Function - Used to close files
- sorted() Function - Used to sort the list in an alphabetical order
- with Statement - A context manager that ensures files are properly opened and closed, even if an error occurs. It simplifies file handling and avoids resource leaks.

CSV Files (Comma Separated Values)
Work with Comma-Separated Values using Pythonâ€™s built-in csv module. This is useful for reading and writing structured tabular data.

Binary File Handling
How to read and write files using binary format, which is essential for non-text data like images or audio.
