Week 2 – Loops in Python
This week in CS50P, I explored one of the most fundamental concepts in programming: loops. Loops allow us to repeat actions efficiently, making our code more powerful and flexible.

Stuff I learned

    1. For Loops - Used to iterate over sequences like strings, lists, or ranges. Great for when you know how many times you want to loop.

    2. While Loops - Used when the number of iterations isn’t known in advance. The loop continues as long as a condition is true.

    3. Loop Control Statements

        break: Exits the loop early.
        continue: Skips the current iteration and moves to the next.
        pass: A placeholder that does nothing (often used in empty blocks).

    4. Loops inside loops — useful for working with multi-dimensional data or repeated patterns.
    
    5. len() Function - Returns the number of items in a sequence (like a string or list). Often used in loops to determine how many times to iterate.

    6. list[] Data Type - A collection of ordered items. Lists are mutable and can store multiple values of different types.

    7. dict{} Data Type - A collection of key-value pairs. Useful for storing and accessing data efficiently.

*Notes:
- Loops help automate repetitive tasks.
- Choosing between for and while depends on the problem.
- Loop control statements more flexibility in how loops behave.
- Be careful with infinite loops — a loop has a way to stop!
