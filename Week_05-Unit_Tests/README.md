In Week 5 of CS50P, I learned how to test my code effectively using unit tests. Testing is a crucial part of the development process, helping ensure that programs behave as expected and making debugging easier.

What I Learned

- Unit Tests - Small, focused tests that check individual parts (units) of a program to verify they work correctly.

- assert Statement - Used to test assumptions in code. If the condition is false, Python raises an AssertionError.

- pytest Framework - A powerful and user-friendly testing tool that automates the running of unit tests and provides detailed feedback.

Key Concepts
- Writing tests helps catch bugs early and improves code reliability.
- assert is a simple way to test expected outcomes during development.
- pytest makes it easy to organize and run multiple tests efficiently.
- Good tests are repeatable, isolated, and clearly document expected behavior.
