In Week 4 of CS50P, I learned how to extend Pythonâ€™s capabilities using libraries and packages. Libraries allow us to reuse powerful tools built by others, while packages help organize and share our own code. This week opened the door to working with randomness, statistics, command-line tools, and even APIs.

What I Learned

- Libraries - Collections of pre-written code that add functionality to Python. Some are built-in, while others can be installed using pip.


- random Library - Used to generate random numbers, shuffle lists, and simulate randomness in programs.


- statistics Library - Provides functions for calculating mean, median, mode, and other statistical measures.


- Command-Line Arguments (sys.argv) - Allows users to pass input to a Python script when running it from the terminal.


- Slice Notation - A way to extract parts of sequences like strings or lists using [start:stop] syntax.


- Packages - A way to organize Python modules into reusable components. You can even create your own packages for personal or public use.


- APIs (Application Programming Interfaces) - Interfaces that allow your code to interact with external services or data sources.


- Creating Your Own Libraries - Learned how to write reusable functions and organize them into modules that can be imported into other projects.



Libraries save time and reduce complexity.
pip is used to install third-party packages.
Command-line arguments make scripts more dynamic and flexible.
APIs allow Python to connect with the web and external data.
Writing your own libraries helps modularize and reuse your code.
